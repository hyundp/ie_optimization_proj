    Description:
        The environment consists of a grid of (size x size) positions. The agent
        starts the episode in location (row=0, col=0) if the environment is instantiated
        without exploring starts or from a random location (different from the goal)
         if it is. The goal is always at (row=size-1, col=size-1).
    Observation:
        Type: MultiDiscrete(2)
        Num     Observation     Min     Max
        0       row coordinate    0       size-1
        1       col coordinate    0       size-1
    Actions:
        Type: Discrete(4)
        Num     Action
        0       Move up
        1       Move right
        2       Move down
        3       Move left
    Reward:
        If the environment is instantiated with shaped rewards, then at each time step
        the agent will receive a reward signal of the following magnitude:

            r = - steps_to_goal(current_state) / steps_to_goal(furthest_state)

        This ensures that the maximum reward awarded will be -1.0 and that at the goal
        the reward will be 0.

        If the environment is instantiated without shaped rewards, then at each time step
        the agent will receive a reward of -1.0 until it reaches the goal.
    Episode termination:
        The episode terminates when the agent reaches the goal state.
